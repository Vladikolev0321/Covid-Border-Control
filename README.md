# Covid-Border-Control

__Summer Internship 2021 at Software AG__ <br>
  You will work with top trending technologies and tools to build our business needs. The exact area of the application that you work on will depend on your skills and interests. Spring is an awesome framework to build RESTful APIs and Microservices and combined with one of the most popular front-end frameworks React, both could make any technical need into a useful and powerful application. All this will be cloud based with integrated CI/CD lifecycle. You will help us translate our vision for team collaboration into a web application based product.


__Idea description:__
<br>
  To slow down the spread of coronavirus and protect the health and well-being of all Europeans, some travel restrictions have been necessary. The European Commission is doing its utmost to allow people to meet friends and family, travel for work and to ensure free movement of citizens, goods and services – with full respect of health and safety measures. To speed up the process of vaccines checks and PCR tests we need to have automated system that will inform us the status of everyone traveling and passing country borders.

__Minimum product implementation:__ <br>
            Stage 1: Microservice oriented architecture.<br>
            Stage 2: AWS landscape containing 3 vms and corresponding security group ( Software AG will provide AWS account for that)<br>
            Stage 3: Modern UI that will be up to date with latest standards for UX  and flow orientation based on Materials UI<br>
            Stage 4: DB storage for all the information available in the application<br>
            
__Difficulty:__<br>
            Stage 1: 7/10 – Will get familiar with Spring and project build dependencies<br>
            Stage 2: 7/10 – Will get familiar with Amazon Web Services portal and services ( EC2, probably S3 and security groups)<br>
            Stage 3: 5/10 – Bind front end application to the back end. Use of Materials UI with React<br>
            Stage 4: 3/10 – Connect application to use DB. Need of DB schema that will fit for the requirements and relations in the application.<br>
            
            
All stages will have milestones with demonstrations and code reviews.<br>
