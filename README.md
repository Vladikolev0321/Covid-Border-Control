# Covid-Border-Control
__Idea description:__
<br>
  To slow down the spread of coronavirus and protect the health and well-being of all Europeans, some travel restrictions have been necessary. The European Commission is doing its utmost to allow people to meet friends and family, travel for work and to ensure free movement of citizens, goods and services â€“ with full respect of health and safety measures. To speed up the process of vaccines checks and PCR tests we need to have automated system that will inform us the status of everyone traveling and passing country borders.
